/**
 * Accurate, book-wide page numbering for reflowable EPUB (research: option 3).
 *
 * A reflowable book has no intrinsic pages — a "page" is `sectionWidth /
 * columnWidth` computed only AFTER a chapter is laid out. epub.js exposes that
 * per-chapter count as `currentLocation().start.displayed.total`, but it resets
 * at every chapter boundary. To get a smooth, book-wide "Page N / M" that ticks
 * by exactly 1 per screen turn, we pre-paginate every spine item and build a
 * prefix sum of per-chapter page counts.
 *
 * The count is width/height-sensitive (epub.js #274: a stage that differs by
 * even 1px can report a different page total for a section). So the walk renders
 * a throwaway Book — parsed from the SAME bytes — into an OFF-SCREEN stage sized
 * to exactly match the visible reader's stage, with the same theme + font
 * settings applied. Because the measuring rendition is fully detached, the walk
 * never moves the page the user is reading: the reader shows the resume position
 * immediately and this runs in the background (see EpubReader).
