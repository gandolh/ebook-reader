/**
 * Error boundary for the code-split readers (brief 15 loads PdfReader/EpubReader
 * via `React.lazy`). A failed chunk download — a stale deploy whose hashed chunk
 * no longer exists, or a flaky network — throws while the lazy component
 * suspends, which without a boundary crashes the whole app. This catches it and
 * renders a recoverable fallback (retry / back to library) instead.
 *
 * `fallback` is a render prop given a `retry` callback. Note: `React.lazy`
 * caches the rejected import promise, so simply re-mounting the same lazy
 * component would re-throw the SAME error — the only reliable re-attempt is a
 * full reload, which also fetches a fresh index.html (new chunk hashes) and is
 * therefore exactly the right recovery for the stale-deploy case. `retry` is
 * wired to that by the caller.
