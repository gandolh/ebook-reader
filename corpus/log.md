## [2026-07-02] decision | Corpus bootstrapped + full spec ingested

Bootstrapped `corpus/` for the ebook-reader project. Folded the finalized spec
from the grill session into the wiki (overview, architecture, decisions, reader,
conversion, status, open-questions). Filed briefs 01–07 covering the full
implementation plan. See [wiki/overview.md](wiki/overview.md).

## [2026-07-02] decision | Tailwind v4 locked (D20)

Resolved the open Tailwind-version question in favor of **Tailwind v4** (matches
Base UI's documented examples). Removed from open-questions; recorded as D20 in
[wiki/decisions.md](wiki/decisions.md). Build to run all waves autonomously.

## [2026-07-02] done | Brief 01 — monorepo scaffold

npm-workspaces monorepo stood up: `@ebook-reader/{web,api,shared}`. React 19 +
Vite 6, Fastify 5 (`tsx watch`, port 3001, `/health`), shared = zod lib. Verified:
`npm install` clean, `npm run typecheck` passes across all three, shared resolves
in both apps. Deferred: gitignored `shared/dist` needs a build before cold-clone
typecheck. See [briefs/done/01-monorepo-scaffold.md](briefs/done/01-monorepo-scaffold.md).
